# ðŸŒŸ Data Analytics Portfolio ðŸŒŸ

Hello, I'm Linh Nguyen. In this portfolio, I include the projects I practiced in various courses. There are also other personal projects which I explored with curiosity.

## ðŸš– Automatidata

#### [Identify data types and relevant variables using Python](automatidata_1_start_python.ipynb)
To get clear insights, New York TLC's data must be analyzed, key variables identified, and the dataset ensured it is ready for analysis.

#### [Exploratory Data Analysis](automatidata_2_eda.ipynb)
I use Python to show data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help understand the data, a box plot of the ride durations, and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month.

#### [Conduct an A/B test](automatidata_3_statistics.ipynb)
The project is reaching its midpoint. Next, I get a specific assignment: to compute descriptive statistics and conduct a hypothesis test.

#### [Build a multiple linear regression model](automatidata_4_regression_analysis.ipynb)
Itâ€™s time to work on predicting the taxi fare amounts. We are ready to build the regression model and update the client New York City TLC about our progress.

#### [Machine Learning](automatidata_5_machine_learning.ipynb)
Our client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), has requested that I build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip since drivers depend on tips.

## ðŸ‘” [Salifort Motors](salifort_motors.ipynb)
In this project, my goals are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

## ðŸš€ [Space Mission](space_mission.ipynb)
An incredibly rich dataset fromÂ [nextspaceflight.com](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/)Â that includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Race between the USA and the Soviet Union in 1957! It has data on the mission status (success/failure), the cost of the mission, the number of launches per country, and much much more.

## ðŸ’° [Earning Predict](earning_predict.ipynb)
The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997-2011 dataset is one of the most important databases available to social scientists working with US data.
It allows scientists to look at the determinants of earnings as well as educational attainment and has incredible relevance for government policy.
When we have a better understanding how these variables affect education and earnings we can also formulate more suitable government policies.
