# ðŸŒŸ Data Analytics Portfolio ðŸŒŸ

Hello, I'm Linh Nguyen. In this portfolio, I include the projects I practiced in various courses. There are also other personal projects which I explored in my free time.

## Google Advanced Data Analyst Certificate

### 1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/linhnds/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/automatidata_eda.ipynb)
I use Python to show data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help understand the data, a box plot of the ride durations, and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month.

### 2. [Machine Learning](https://github.com/linhnds/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/automatidata_machine-learning.ipynb)
Our client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), has requested that I build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip since drivers depend on tips.

### 3. [Salifort Motors](https://github.com/linhnds/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/salifort-motors.ipynb)
In this project, my goals are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.
