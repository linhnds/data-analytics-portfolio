# ðŸŒŸ Data Analytics Portfolio ðŸŒŸ

Hello, I'm Linh Nguyen. In this portfolio, I include the projects I practiced in various courses. There are also other personal projects which I explored in my free time.

## ðŸš– Automatidata

#### [Identify data types and relevant variables using Python](https://github.com/linhnds/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/automatidata_1_start_python.ipynb)
To get clear insights, New York TLC's data must be analyzed, key variables identified, and the dataset ensured it is ready for analysis.

#### [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/linhnds/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/automatidata_2_eda.ipynb)
I use Python to show data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help understand the data, a box plot of the ride durations, and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month.

#### [Conduct an A/B test](https://github.com/linhnds/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/automatidata_3_statistics.ipynb)
The project is reaching its midpoint. Next, I get a specific assignment: to compute descriptive statistics and conduct a hypothesis test.

#### [Build a multiple linear regression model](https://github.com/linhnds/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/automatidata_4_regression_analysis.ipynb)
Itâ€™s time to work on predicting the taxi fare amounts. We are ready to build the regression model and update the client New York City TLC about our progress.

#### [Machine Learning](https://github.com/linhnds/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/automatidata_5_machine_learning.ipynb)
Our client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), has requested that I build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip since drivers depend on tips.

## ðŸ‘” [Salifort Motors](https://github.com/linhnds/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/salifort_motors.ipynb)
In this project, my goals are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

## ðŸš€ [Space Mission](https://github.com/linhnds/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/space_mission.ipynb)
An incredibly rich dataset fromÂ [nextspaceflight.com](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/past/?page=1)Â that includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Race between the USA and the Soviet Union in 1957! It has data on the mission status (success/failure), the cost of the mission, the number of launches per country, and much much more.
